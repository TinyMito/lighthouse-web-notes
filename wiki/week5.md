# Week 5 Notes
## Promise
The `Promise()` is a built-in function to handle async callback in a more readable format. 

### There are four stages in creating Promises:

1. Wrapping (syntax, or the Promise structure)
2. Thening (when it works)
3. Catching (recovery, when there's an error)
4. Chaining (where you create long sequences of asynchronous work)

### And, there are four states of a Promise:

1. Fulfilled (it worked!)
2. Rejected (failed)
3. Pending (still waiting...)
4. Settled (something happened)

## API - Application Programming Interface
An API is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that specifies how software components should interact with each other. It defines the way in which different software systems and components can communicate with each other, and it provides a standardized interface for different applications to exchange data and services.

In the context of web development, an API typically refers to a set of web-based endpoints that allow external applications to communicate with a web server or web application. These endpoints can be used to perform various operations, such as retrieving data, submitting data, or triggering specific actions on the server.

APIs can be used for a variety of purposes, such as integrating different applications or services, automating workflows, or building new applications on top of existing systems. They are a crucial component of modern software development, as they allow developers to build more flexible and scalable applications that can interact with a variety of other systems and services.
